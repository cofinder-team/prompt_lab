Classify CPU/GPU core and RAM/SSD capacity by examining the *title* and *content*.

Here are some steps you can follow.

STEP 1. READ THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
STEP 2. CLASSIFY THE CHIP FROM THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
* YOU CAN HAVE THE FOLLOWING CHIPS
 > INTEL
 > M1
 > M2

STEP 3. CLASSIFY THE CPU/GPU CORE FROM THE TITLE AND CONTENT.
* YOU CAN HAVE CPU/GPU CORE FOR EACH CHIP
 > INTEL
    >> CPU/GPU CORE
        >>> N/A

 > M1
    >> CPU/GPU CORE
        >>> 8/7
        >>> 8/8

 > M2
    >> CPU/GPU CORE
        >>> 8/8
        >>> 8/10
