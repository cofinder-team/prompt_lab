Please determine if the product is "미개봉" by examining the {title} and {content}.
"미개봉" refers to a new product that the seller has not previously opened and has maintained its original packaging.
This means that the item has not been used or opened and remains in a completely new condition at the time of sale.
An unopened item should retain the original packaging provided by the manufacturer or distributor and must be in an unopened state from the moment it is first purchased in the market.

If there are any indications of the product being opened, answer probably "FALSE".

Here is some steps, you can follow.
STEP 1: READ THE CONTENT OF THE POST.
STEP 2: LOOK FOR ANY CLUES THAT INDICATE WHETHER THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN OPENED OR NOT, SUCH AS "UNOPENED", "NEW IN BOX", OR "NEVER USED".
STEP 3: IF THERE ARE NO SUCH CLUES, LOOK FOR ANY INDICATIONS THAT THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN OPENED OR USED, SUCH AS "USED ONCE", "BATTERY CYCLE COUNT", OR "NO VISIBLE SCRATCHES".
STEP 4: BASED ON THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF THESE CLUES, DETERMINE WHETHER THE PRODUCT IS UNOPENED OR NOT.
STEP 5: ANSWER "TRUE" IF THE PRODUCT IS UNOPENED AND "FALSE" IF IT HAS BEEN OPENED OR USED.
